# Security Model

DevSpace exposes local coding capabilities over MCP. Treat it as remote access
to your development machine.

The security model is simple:

- you choose a narrow filesystem allowlist
- the MCP endpoint requires OAuth approval with your Owner password
- Host headers are allowlisted from the configured public URL
- every coding action happens through explicit MCP tool calls

## Filesystem Allowlist

DevSpace only opens workspaces under configured roots.

Good examples:

```text
~/work
~/personal/open-source
```

Avoid broad roots:

```text
~
/
C:\
```

The narrower the root, the easier it is to reason about what the MCP client can
reach.

## Owner Password

`devspace init` generates an Owner password and stores it in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

When an MCP client connects, DevSpace shows an approval page. Enter the Owner
password only when you intentionally want that client to access this server.

For env-driven deployments, set a long random value:

```bash
DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

## Public URL And Host Allowlist

DevSpace needs `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so MCP clients can discover OAuth
metadata and connect to the correct resource.

The value should be the origin only:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Do not include `/mcp` in `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

By default, DevSpace derives allowed Host headers from the local host and public
URL. Use `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*` only for intentional local debugging.

## Tunnels

DevSpace does not manage tunnels. Your tunnel or reverse proxy should point to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676
```

Prefer adding Cloudflare Access, Tailscale identity controls, or equivalent
protection in front of public tunnels. DevSpace OAuth still protects the MCP
endpoint, but the tunnel URL should not be treated as a secret.

## Shell Access

The shell tool is powerful by design. It is meant for tests, builds, git, and
package scripts.

Filesystem path containment applies to DevSpace file tools. Shell commands run
as local commands and can do what your user account can do. This is why the MCP
client must be trusted and the Owner password must stay private.

## File Export Links

`export_file` is workspace-scoped and accepts only relative paths that resolve
to regular files inside the open workspace. DevSpace copies the file to a
private temporary snapshot before creating the link, so later edits to the
workspace file cannot change an existing download.

Download URLs are intentionally accessible without OAuth. Each URL contains a
256-bit random bearer token, expires after five minutes by default, is returned
only to the authenticated MCP caller, and is redacted from request logs. Treat
an unexpired URL like a secret: anyone who receives it can download that one
snapshot. Responses disable caching and content sniffing. Per-file, entry-count,
and aggregate-byte limits bound temporary storage use.

The snapshot directory is process-specific under the operating system temporary
directory. Expired snapshots are deleted periodically; all remaining snapshots
are deleted during a clean shutdown. Normal operating-system temporary-file
cleanup remains a fallback after an unclean exit.

## Worktrees

Managed worktrees reduce accidental edits to your active checkout, but they are
not a security boundary. They are a workflow boundary for isolated coding
sessions.

## Logs

By default, DevSpace logs requests and tool calls. Shell command previews are
disabled unless `DEVSPACE_LOG_SHELL_COMMANDS=1`.

File export tokens are never included in request or export event logs. Export
events include only metadata such as size, MIME type, expiry, and a short hash
prefix.

Do not enable shell command logging if commands may contain secrets.
